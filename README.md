Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a driving instruction company who hired our company to develop a new, web based system for them. They needed it to provide online materials, tests, and to be able to schedule on the road driving instruction.

What did you do particularly well?

I think that I did a good job interpreting the client's needs and translating them to clear, easy to follow UML diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think that I would choose my presentation to revise. I could have been more mindful of my audience's lack of technical knowledge and used more basic language.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user's needs are paramount to designing; they are the entire reason the system is being designed in the first place. Utilizing things such as meetings or surveys can give a development team a great picture of what their client or userbase wants in terms of funcionality.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I find it easy to be overwhelmed by design at times. Focusing on small, more manageable portions helps to aleviate this.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? 

My academic career has given me all of the critical thinking and communication skills needed to take the most important parts of a client's needs to design a system for. Looking at other, successful examples gives a good starting point to build from.

How do you approach designing software?

As stated, I approach designing in small, more bite sized chunks. Once each issue or need has a solution, then I can start to think about how these solutions interact and become a functioning system.
